QUESTION : What are void elements in HTML ?

ANSWER : 

Void Element :=>

A void element is an element in HTML that can not have any kind of child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.

In HTML, a void element must not have an end tag. For example, 
<input type="text"></input> is invalid HTML. In contrast, SVG or MathML elements that cannot have any child nodes may use an end tag instead of XML self-closing-tag syntax in their start tag.

The HTML,SVG and MathML specifications define very precisely what each element can contain. So, some combinations of tags have no semantic meaning.

Although there is no way to mark up void element as having any children, child nodes can be added programmatically to the element in the DOM using JavaScript. But that is not a good practice, as the outcome will not be reliable.

The void elements in HTML are as follows : 

<area>
<base>
<br>
<col>
<embed>
<hr>
<img>
<input>
<key.gen>
<link>
<meta>
<param>
<source>
<tarck>
<wbr>
