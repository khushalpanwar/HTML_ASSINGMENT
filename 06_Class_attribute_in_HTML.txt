QUESTION : What is the 'class' attribute in HTML ?

ANSWER : 


The class attribute specifies one or more class_names for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
