QUESTION : What are tags and attributes in HTML ?

ANSWER : 

1.) HTML Tags :

HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an opening bracket followed by the element's name and, finally, a closing bracket.

In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.

As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. The first one is the start tag. It contains two opposite angle brackets.

Example include:
- <title>
- <p>
- <b>

The other one is the end tag. The similarity to the start tag, it has angle brackets. However, there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket. Examples of the end tags corresponding to the start tags above are as follows.

- </title>
- </p>
- </b>

In other cases, the tags may contain other aspects. That usually happens when it comes to the opening tags. They may contain an extra attribute, including the likes of height, width, or CSS class name, among others.





2.) HTML Attribute :

In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element. It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside the opening tag. They controls the behavior of the element that follows.

Every tag has two sections. The first one is usually the name of the attribute, while the other one is its value. The two are usually separated by an equals sign (=). Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that needs modifications.

One can enclose the value of an attribute using either double or single quotes. In some cases where there is the usage of certain characters, quoting may not be necessary. It is good to note that the rules may be different when it comes to the other languages, including the sister one, XHTML.
