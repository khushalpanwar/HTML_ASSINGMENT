	<p>QUESTION : What is the use of a span tag ? Explain with example.</p>

	<p>
		The 'span' tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

		The 'span' tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

		The 'span' tag is much like the 'div' element, but 'div' is a block-level element and 'span' is an inline element.
	</p>

		<span>Example :</span>

	<p>My gf has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
